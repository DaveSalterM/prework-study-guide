# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project came to fruition from my desire to switch careers after 14 years in the brewing industry. This was an introduction to get me aquainted with coding basics, methodololgy, and mindset in a new field. This study guide will provide references and an outline of the materials we will be taking a deeper dive into during coding bootcamp. It will be a useful tool as a quick reference without having to search through all of the previously studied material. Building this study guide was a great introduction into what will be faced in the coding bootcamp including common coding basics, debugging, program languages, and integrating said languages.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is divided into sections to easily navigate common terminology associated with each topic. Included in the "Git" section is a "Git Cheat Sheet" hyperlink that will take you to a list of different Git commands in a seperate browser tab to help you easily recall commands without navigating away from your current page. While running DevTools ( shortcut ctrl + shift + I in Google Chrome Dev) this study guide will provide you with a randomized topic to study from the prework list.
