        <ul>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information (<b>metadata</b>) about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The <b>doctype</b> (which is not case sensitive) declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>The <b>lang="en"</b> element tells the browser the language for the webpage (English in this example).</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage, which is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization, the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines).</li>
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>meta</b> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport. Information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the "head" or "meta" elements.</li>
          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements listed inside other elements are called <b>child</b> elements, which are contained by <b>parent</b> elements.</li>
          <li>Use <b>Semantic Elements</b> when possible. Semantic elements define their meaning such as <b>form</b> or <b>table</b>, whereas <b>div</b> and <b>span</b> do not.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          
          <ul>
            <li>A <b>Margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li><b>Padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
              <div><b> - Inline:</b> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</div>
              <div><b> - Internal Style Sheet:</b> CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</div>
              <div><b> - External CSS Style Sheet:</b> This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</div>
            <li><b>Separation of concerns</b> is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
            <li><b>Declarations</b> contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property (i.e. {color:blue} where color = property and blue = value).</li>
            <li>Use [*] to apply to all elements, or [,] to combine multiple elements.</li>
            <li><b>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)</b>is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
            <li><b>Class Attributes</b> allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

          <ul>
            
           <li>A <b>variable</b> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
           <li><b>Control Flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript runs code from the first statement at top in order to the last statement at the bottom. Order matters.</li>
           <li>We've used <b>Chrome Dev Tools</b> with the <b>"console.log"</b> method to output a message to the web console by adding an <b>argument</b>, making it easier to test and debug code</li>
           <li><b>Conditional Statements</b> will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true (<b>Truthy</b>).</li>
           <div><b>-</b> A value is considered <b>Falsy</b> if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a <b>Boolean</b> (a result that can only have one of two possible values) data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy</div>
           <li>An <b>Array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of (typically related)</li>
           <li>An <b>Index</b> identifies individual data items inside an Array with a location number (many programming languages start with an index of 0</li>
           <li>A <b>Loop</b> is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</li>
           <li><b>Commenting out code</b> makes it inactive without deleting it by adding <b>/*</b> before the block of code and <b>*/</b> after.</li>
           <li>A <b>Function</b> is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions do not automatically execute, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
